## Decision Framing
> **The Decision** Determining the optimal allocation of the team's remaining $8.5M Salary Cap space for the 2026-2027 season: Should the team prioritize acquiring **High-Danger Chance Generation (Elite Offence)** or **High-Danger Chance Suppression (Elite Defence)** to maximize the statistical probability of a Stanley Cup victory?

## Executive Summary
In the modern NHL, the salary cap is the ultimate equalizer; championship teams are formed not by just acquiring skill, but by optimizing "wins per dollar" more effectively than their competition. The Detroit Red Wings are currently at a critical strategic turning point: following a seven-year rebuild, the franchise remains stuck in the statistical "bubble", too competitive to secure top lottery draft picks, but lacking the elite roster efficiency required to contend for the Stanley Cup. With approximately $8.5M in remaining salary cap space for the 2026-2027 season, General Manager Steve Yzerman faces a high-stakes resource allocation challenge that will determine the franchise’s trajectory for the next decade.

This project addresses the core tension of roster construction: the trade-off between purchasing scarce, high-premium offensive production versus investing in cost-effective defensive suppression. While traditional hockey wisdom often favours "safe" defensive depth, modern analytics suggest that elite high-danger chance generation may offer a higher Return on Investment (ROI) in terms of pure win probability. However, due to the salary cap, investing heavily in one area mathematically necessitates weakness in the other.

Using a Decision Intelligence framework, this analysis utilizes historical player data and predictive modelling to assess the impact of these opposing strategies on playoff success. Demonstrating the feedback loops among roster investment, on-ice performance, and cap flexibility provides the General Manager with data-backed advice on how to utilize the team's remaining financial assets to maximize the likelihood of winning the Stanley Cup in 2027.

## Casual Loop Diagram
The model visualizes the systemic tension between the pressure to win and financial reality:

**R1:** The Success Cycle (Reinforcing Loop): This loop illustrates the cost of success. As Win Probability increases, it drives up Playoff Revenue and Fan/Owner Pressure. This pressure compels management to double down on Allocation to Elite Offense to maintain dominance, creating a snowball effect of rising expectations and spending.

**B1:** The Salary Cap Squeeze (Balancing Loop): This loop acts as the system's hard constraint. Increasing the Allocation to Elite Offense directly reduces the Cap Space for Defense/Depth. This depletion harms Defensive Stability, which drags down Win Probability. This balancing mechanism limits the effectiveness of purely offensive investment, as the team eventually becomes too "top-heavy" and vulnerable defensively.
